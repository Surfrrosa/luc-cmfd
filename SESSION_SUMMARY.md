# Session Summary - Oct 24, 2025

**What We Built Today:** Complete competition infrastructure for top 3-5 push

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Documentation (Complete ✓)
**Created comprehensive competition playbook:**
- **COMPETITION_FRAMEWORK.md** (920 lines) - Master playbook with:
  - All KPIs and measurement criteria
  - Decision gates (go/no-go rules)  
  - Milestone targets (M0-M5)
  - Statistical confidence measures (bootstrap validation)
  - Daily/weekly rhythm
  - Red flags and risk mitigation
  - Ensemble/TTA/pseudo-labeling strategies
  - Success criteria for top 3-5

- **CONTEXT.md** (508 lines) - Complete project history
- **QUICKSTART.md** - 3-step quickstart guide
- **QUALITY_STATUS.md** - Implementation summary
- **START_HERE.md** - Navigation guide for fresh Claude instances

**Result:** Zero context loss if conversation ends. Any future Claude can read COMPETITION_FRAMEWORK.md and be fully equipped to execute the plan.

### 2. Ensemble Infrastructure (Partial ✓)
**Created fit_ensemble.py:**
- NNLS and Ridge weight fitting
- Bootstrap validation with 95% CI
- Individual model evaluation
- Collinearity warnings
- Auto-saves weights to JSON
- Expected gain: +0.03-0.05 F1

**Still Needed:**
- Ensemble inference support in infer.py
- Ensemble config (ensemble.yaml)
- Final submission configs (final_safe.yaml, final_push.yaml)

### 3. Quality Improvements (Complete ✓)
**Earlier today:**
- Validated submission format (round-trip tests pass)
- Created 150-image dev subset (balanced, seed=42)
- Added probability clamping for numerical stability
- All SOTA features implemented and ready

### 4. Version Control (Complete ✓)
**Git repository:**
- 39 files committed
- 10,210 lines of code + documentation
- Full history preserved
- GitHub: https://github.com/Surfrrosa/luc-cmfd

## What's Ready to Execute

### Milestone M0 (Complete ✓)

- [x] 150-image dev subset
- [x] SAFE config <2h projected
- [x] All SOTA features implemented
- [x] Git repository with full documentation
- [x] Competition framework documented

### Milestone M1 (Ready to Start)
**Requirements:**
- Train single model with accuracy.yaml
- First submission ≥ baseline +0.02 F1
- Notebook wall-clock <3h

**Next Steps:**
1. Upload kaggle_train.ipynb to Kaggle
2. Attach competition dataset
3. Set GPU ON
4. Train for 50 epochs (~2-3h)
5. Download weights
6. Run inference
7. Validate submission
8. Submit to Kaggle

---

## Remaining Work for Top 3-5 Push

### High Priority (M1-M3)
1. **Train first model** - Get baseline submission
2. **A/B test features** - Validate each SOTA improvement
3. **Optimize runtime** - Stay under 3.5h budget

### Medium Priority (M4)
4. **Complete ensemble infrastructure:**
   - Add ensemble inference to infer.py
   - Create ensemble.yaml config
   - Create final_safe.yaml and final_push.yaml
5. **Train 7 models:**
   - 5 with different seeds
   - 1 backbone variant (vitb14)
   - 1 corr-only baseline
6. **Fit ensemble weights** - Use fit_ensemble.py

### Lower Priority (M5)
7. **Extend TTA** - 12 augmentations for final push
8. **Add auto-budgeter** - Runtime projection and blocking
9. **Pseudo-labeling** - One-loop with high confidence (0.95)
10. **Domain boost** - Panel detection OR hard-negative mining

## Expected Performance

### Conservative (High Probability)
- **Baseline (M1):** F1 ~0.65-0.70 (decoder only)
- **With SOTA (M2):** F1 ~0.70-0.75 (features promoted via A/B)
- **Leaderboard:** Top 25% (85% probability)

### Realistic (Medium Probability)
- **With Ensemble (M4):** F1 ~0.73-0.78
- **Leaderboard:** Top 10% (60-75% probability)

### Optimistic (Achievable with Full Execution)
- **With Ensemble + TTA + Domain (M5):** F1 ~0.75-0.81
- **Leaderboard:** Top 5 (50-60% probability)
- **Leaderboard:** Top 3 (20-30% probability)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Three-Config Strategy
- **safe.yaml:** <2h runtime (fallback)
- **accuracy.yaml:** <3.5h runtime (recommended)
- **ensemble.yaml:** <4h runtime (final push)

### 2. Statistical Rigor
- Bootstrap 95% CI for promotions (avoid noise)
- Promotion rule: ΔF1 ≥ +0.01 AND Δruntime ≤ +10%
- Holdout validation to detect overfit

### 3. Ensemble Approach
- 7 models total (5 seeds + 1 variant + 1 baseline)
- NNLS weight fitting (non-negative, minimizes L2 error)
- 3-model subset for daily runs, full 7 for final

### 4. TTA Strategy
- Light TTA (3×) for daily: {none, hflip, rot90}
- Aggressive TTA (12×) for final: all rotations + flips
- Auto-budgeter blocks if projected >3.6h

### 5. Domain Enhancements
- Pick ONE to implement: panel detection OR hard-negative mining
- A/B test on curated micro-set before promoting
- Must clear same gates as other features

## Immediate Next Action

**Tomorrow (or whenever you resume):**

1. Read COMPETITION_FRAMEWORK.md (20 min)
2. Upload kaggle_train.ipynb to Kaggle
3. Train first model with configs/accuracy.yaml
4. Generate first submission
5. Validate and submit

**Command:**
```bash
# On Kaggle notebook
!python train_kaggle.py \
  --batch_size 16 \
  --epochs 50 \
  --config configs/accuracy.yaml \
  --output_dir weights
```

Then download weights and run inference locally or on Kaggle.
