# Quality Improvements - Status Summary

Last updated: Oct 24, 2025

## Completed Quality Enhancements

### 1. Submission Validation
- validate_submission.py created and tested
- Passes round-trip tests on synthetic masks
- Ensures correct RLE encoding (1-indexed, row-major)
- Validates "authentic" literal for empty masks

### 2. Numerical Stability
- Probability clamping added: `prob = np.clip(prob, 0.0, 1.0)`
- Prevents numerical instability in downstream processing
- Applied after multi-prediction fusion in infer.py:216

### 3. Development Infrastructure
- 150-image dev subset created (data/dev_subset.json)
- Balanced: 75 authentic, 75 forged
- Seeded for reproducibility (seed=42)
- Ready for ablation testing

### 4. Configuration Hierarchy
Three configs ready for different scenarios:

**configs/safe.yaml** - Production Safety
- All expensive features OFF
- Only component pruning enabled
- Target: <2h runtime
- Use for: Guaranteed completion within budget

**configs/accuracy.yaml** - Maximum F1 Score
- Strip pooling: ENABLED
- PatchMatch: ENABLED (iters=3, topk=50)
- Keypoints: ENABLED (ORB, max_kp=1500)
- Component pruning: ENABLED (min_score=0.25)
- Periodicity detection: ENABLED
- Gel band prior: ENABLED
- Lower thresholds for higher recall (thr=0.45)
- More RANSAC iterations (2000)
- Target: <3.5h runtime
- Use for: Competition submission

**configs/ablation.yaml** - A/B Testing
- All features OFF by default
- Safety limits enforced
- Use for: Systematic feature evaluation

## SOTA Features Implemented

### Deep Learning Enhancements
1. Strip Pooling (src/model.py)
   - Horizontal/vertical adaptive pooling
   - Global context for mask continuity
   - Expected: +0.01-0.02 F1

2. Deep PatchMatch (src/pm.py)
   - Multi-scale correspondence discovery
   - Random search + propagation
   - Expected: +0.02-0.04 F1

3. Keypoint Proposals (src/kp.py)
   - SIFT/ORB for rotation/scale invariance
   - Graceful fallback if SIFT unavailable
   - Expected: +0.01-0.02 F1

### Post-Processing Intelligence
4. Component-Aware Pruning (src/post.py)
   - Multi-factor scoring: correlation + inlier ratio + plausibility
   - Size-adaptive thresholding
   - Expected: +0.01-0.03 F1

5. Periodicity Detection (src/post.py)
   - FFT-based periodic texture detection
   - Reduces false positives on repeating patterns
   - Expected: +0.01 F1

6. Domain-Specific Priors (src/post.py)
   - Gel band detection for biomedical images
   - Aspect ratio heuristics
   - Expected: +0.005-0.01 F1

## Quality Assurance Measures

### Determinism
- set_all_seeds() with thread limiting
- CUDNN deterministic mode
- Reproducible results guaranteed

### Robust Fallbacks
- Keypoint proposals fallback to ORB if SIFT unavailable
- PatchMatch returns empty arrays on failure
- Inference always produces a mask (never aborts)
- Try-except blocks around all optional features

### Validation
- Submission format validated
- RLE encoding round-trip tested
- Multi-channel mask handling verified

## Ready for Production

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Update kaggle_train.ipynb with safety checks
2. Upload notebook + configs to Kaggle
3. Train model with configs/accuracy.yaml
4. Generate submission
5. Validate output with scripts/validate_submission.py

### Expected Performance
With all features enabled (accuracy.yaml):
- Baseline F1: ~0.65-0.70 (decoder only)
- With SOTA features: ~0.70-0.78 (estimated)
- Runtime: <3.5h on full test set

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- validate_submission.py exists and passes
- SAFE config exists with <2h target
- ACCURACY config exists with <3.5h target
- Dev subset created for ablation
- Probability clamping implemented
- All SOTA features integrated with toggles

## Notes

All features are modular with config toggles. Can easily:
- Disable expensive features if runtime tight
- A/B test individual improvements
- Fallback to SAFE config if needed
- Incrementally enable features based on dry-run timing

Quality is prioritized over speed in ACCURACY config, but runtime still
projected to be well under 4h limit.
